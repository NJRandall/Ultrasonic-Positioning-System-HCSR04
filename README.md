# Ultrasonic Positioning System HCSR04
**Background**

This system was part of a semester long design project at the University of Melbourne. The task was to propose a prototype concerned with improving undergound fibre optic cabling. My team chose to focus on a guidance system. The aim was to demonstrate the capability of a sound based positioning system to improve upon the rather limited complexcities of tunneling routes on residencial properties. Hypothetically this would hope to justify a more robust (and expensive) underground model. Due to time constraints and limited resources many components were scrapped such as emulating underground noise, travesing complex routes and my favourite, a dynamic accurarcy linked to the number of sensors.

**Brief**

The prior is mostly flavour text and the following is my component of the project and the namesake of this repository. I've made most of a scaleable arduino based system to use 2 or more very cheap and accessible HCSR04 ultrasonic sensors to act as transmitters and recievers. Using these sensors the code outputs a set of 2-dimensional co-ordinates to determine the objects position within a pre-determined boundaried space. I didn't have much time or purpose to make a more extensive system however given the limitations of HCSR04 sensors I wouldn't advise going much further than what I've created.
